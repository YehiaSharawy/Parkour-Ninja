# Parkour-Ninja ðŸ¥·
The game features a ninja who continuously jumps across platforms and blocks to collect coins, with each coin adding to the score. The game has three levels, each increasing in difficulty.

- Level 1 takes place above the clouds and skyscrapers.
- Level 2 moves into the city.
- Level 3 is set in space.

As the ninja progresses, the challenges become more difficult. Moving barrier blocks can defeat the player, sending them back to checkpoints. Some blocks move at varying speeds, and with each level, their speed increases, making the gameplay more challenging.
